## {{ site.heading_one }}:
NRDC’s analysis shows that Washington, D.C., already sees an average of more than two weeks’ worth of extreme summer heat days per year.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> The District of Columbia had a particularly deadly year in 2011, when 11 heat-related deaths were reported.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from energy use in Washington, D.C., declined 23.1 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[4](#f4)</sup> in part due to the district’s efforts to increase clean energy<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> and make buildings and transportation more efficient.<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[7](#f7)</sup> of D.C. residents. The district’s plan to protect people from the impacts of more extreme heat includes replacing heat-absorbing paved surfaces with cooler green space, offering incentives to property owners who improve the thermal safety of their buildings, and improving the city’s heat emergency plans.<sup>[8](#f8)</sup>
