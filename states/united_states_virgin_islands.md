## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in United States Virgin Islands, which have climbed about 1.5°F since the early 1900s, are expected to exceed historical records by about 11°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>. In United States Virgin Islands, 9 counties have reported an average of one or more extreme heat days each year, 100 counties have reported the presence of allergenic ragweed, and 9 counties suffer from both. This double whammy of air quality threats is particularly dangerous for the estimated 172,000 children and 555,000 adults with asthma in this state<sup>[2](#f2)</sup>. Climate change worsens smog and boosts pollen production, increasing respiratory health threats.

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can make the air safer and healthier by reducing pollution from power plants, cars, and other big polluters. For example, carbon limits on power plants will also cut smog and soot and reduce premature deaths and hospital visits for heart and breathing problems. **United States Virgin Islands could avoid more than $976.4 million in health costs in 2020 by cleaning up its air**<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>.
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from United States Virgin Islands’s energy use declined 19.5 percent from 2005 to 2014, in part due to the state’s efforts to increase clean energy and make buildings and transportation more efficient. However, climate change already threatens the health of United States Virgin Islands residents<sup>[4](#f4)</sup>. The state’s current strategy to prepare for the health impacts of dirtier air includes a measure to track changes in allergic or respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease that might be associated with air pollution.
