<sup>* Extreme summer heat days: 2007–2016; heat-related health estimates: 2005–2012; population: 2015 census.</sup>

## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Rhode Island, which have climbed more than 3°F since the early 1900s, are expected to exceed historical records by about 10°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Rhode Island, three counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with one of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> In Rhode Island, the rate of heat-related emergency room visits increases nearly 24 percent when the daily high temperature goes from 75°F to 85°F.<sup>[4](#f4)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Rhode Island’s energy use declined 5.4 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> in part due to the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> and its related efforts to increase clean energy<sup>[7](#f7)</sup> and make buildings and transportation more efficient.<sup>[8](#f8)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[9](#f9)</sup> of Rhode Island residents. The state does not have a climate adaptation plan to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat,<sup>[10](#f10)</sup> but it is collecting ideas from other states for possible preparedness measures.<sup>[11](#f11)</sup>
