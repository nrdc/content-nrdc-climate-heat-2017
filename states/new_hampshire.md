## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in New Hampshire, which have climbed about 3°F since the early 1900s, are expected to exceed historical averages by about 16°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in New Hampshire, seven counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with one of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> In New Hampshire, heat stress causes an average of nearly 200 emergency room visits and more than 10 hospitalizations a year.<sup>[4](#f4)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from New Hampshire’s energy use declined 29.6 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> in part due to the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> and its related efforts to increase clean energy<sup>[7](#f7)</sup> and make buildings more efficient.<sup>[8](#f8)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[9](#f9)</sup> of New Hampshire residents. The state’s strategy to prepare for climate change includes assessing and improving the strength of state and local emergency response plans,<sup>[10](#f10)</sup> but the state needs to develop a more concrete plan to protect people from more extreme heat.
