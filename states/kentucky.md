## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Kentucky, which have climbed about 2°F since the 1960s, are expected to exceed historical records by about 11°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Kentucky, 21 counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with 10 of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> In Kentucky, heat stress causes an average of nearly 1,500 emergency room visits and more than 150 hospitalizations a year.<sup>[4](#f4)</sup> A particularly deadly year was 2011, when 17 heat-related deaths were reported.<sup>[5](#f5)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Kentucky’s energy use declined 9.4 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> in part due to the state’s efforts to increase clean energy<sup>[7](#f7)</sup> and make buildings more efficient.<sup>[8](#f8)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[9](#f9)</sup> of Kentucky residents, and the state does not have a climate adaptation plan to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat.<sup>[10](#f10)</sup>
