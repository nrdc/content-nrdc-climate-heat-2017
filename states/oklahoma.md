## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Oklahoma have climbed less than 1°F since the early 1900s, but they are expected to exceed historical records by about 11°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Oklahoma, 34 counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with 16 of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> Oklahoma had a particularly deadly year in 2006, when 38 heat-related deaths were reported.<sup>[4](#f4)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Oklahoma’s energy use declined just 2 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> and the state does not have a climate adaptation plan to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat.<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> Oklahoma needs to do more to protect the health of state residents from the threat of climate change.<sup>[7](#f7)</sup>
