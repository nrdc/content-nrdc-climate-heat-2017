## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Alaska, which have climbed about 2.5°F since the 1970s, are expected to exceed historical records by about 17°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Alaska, 20 counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with 3 of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Alaska’s energy use declined 26.9 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[4](#f4)</sup> in part due to the state’s efforts to make buildings and transportation more efficient.<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> of Alaska residents. The state’s climate strategy identifies heat stress as a health threat of climate change but doesn’t propose specific measures to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat.<sup>[7](#f7)</sup>
