## {{ site.heading_one }}:
Average temperatures in Delaware, which have climbed more than 2°F since the early 1900s, are expected to exceed historical averages by about 13°F by the end of the century if high carbon pollution levels continue globally.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> NRDC’s analysis shows that in Delaware, two counties already see an average of more than nine extreme summer heat days per year, with 1 of those counties averaging more than two weeks’ worth of extremely hot summer days.<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> Climate change is fueling hotter summer days and increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>*

## {{ site.heading_two }}:
We can help reduce extreme heat and prevent related deaths and illnesses in the future by establishing early warning systems, cooling centers, and hospital and health system preparedness plans; by planting trees and using cooler paving and roofing materials in our communities; and by cleaning up power plants, vehicles, and other big emitters of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

## {{ site.heading_three }}:
Heat-trapping carbon pollution from Delaware’s energy use declined 23.6 percent from 2005 to 2014,<sup>[4](#f4)</sup> in part due to the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative<sup>[5](#f5)</sup> and its related efforts to increase clean energy<sup>[6](#f6)</sup> and make buildings and transportation more efficient.<sup>[7](#f7)</sup> However, climate change already threatens the health<sup>[8](#f8)</sup> of Delaware residents. Delaware’s climate framework recommends developing methods for mapping vulnerable populations, identifying sites for designated cooling centers, and expanding the monitoring of health outcomes during heat waves,<sup>[9](#f9)</sup> but the state needs to develop a concrete plan to prepare for the health impacts of more extreme heat.
